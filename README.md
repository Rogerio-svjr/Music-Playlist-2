# Music Playlist 2

This is a personal project developed with the objective of applying the concepts I've learned in my programmig studies, so it is still incomplete.

The application will be responsible for managing various music playlist. You'll be able to create playlists, insert and remove musics in them and also delete entire playlists if you want.

Using the Spotify API you can search for all the spotify portfolio of musics to add you favorite songs in your playlists, althog although the audio file is restricted for premium spotify users, so the application can only save the music informations such as name, artist, albuns, duration, and so on.

The next step is to use JDBC to link the application to a MySQL database, so the musics can actually stay saved in the playlists.

After that i'll need to study about frontend concepts like HTML and CSS to create an user interface for the application and how to link everything in the project.
